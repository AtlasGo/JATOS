{"name":"Jatos","tagline":"Just Another Tool for Online Studies","body":"The JATOS (Just Another Tool for Online Studies) greatly simplifies the setup of online studies that use [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com) (MTurk) as a marketplace to recruit participants. The demands of scientific studies often exceed the possibilities offered by the MTurk alone. JATOS acts as a middleware between the MTurk and your custom-made study, running as an external [HIT](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/help?helpPage=overview#what_is_hit). Itâ€™s a GUI-based, easy-to-use web application that manages and delivers your studies and provides easy access to the results.   \r\n\r\n### JATOS allows you to...\r\n\r\n- Run studies on your own server. This means that you keep complete control over the client side of your participants with your own, tailor-made studies, easily written in HTML/JavaScript/CSS.\r\n- Concentrate on the actual studies, while JATOS will care for the server side.\r\n- Divide your studies into simple, reusable sub tasks (called components). You can jump freely between components, and even loop between them.  \r\n- Make sure that each participant does your study only once.\r\n- Safely store your result data.\r\n- Connect to the MTurk by generating and storing payment confirmation codes. Each code is associated with its study results, so payment can be confirmed based on participants' performance criteria. \r\n\r\nAnd it's open source and free to use (published under Apache 2 licence).\r\n\r\n\r\n### JATOS' *GUI* allows you to...\r\n\r\n- Do everything within your browser.\r\n- Modify input parameters such as stimuli and timing from the GUI, with no need to modify the study scripts every time.\r\n- Flexibly (one-click) change the order of the components in a study.\r\n- Preview your entire study, or even its individual components.  \r\n- Easily access the study results.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot GUI](https://github.com/JATOS/JATOS/wiki/images/Screenshot_from_2014-11-19.png)\r\n\r\n### How to start\r\n\r\n1.
